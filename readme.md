meteor ecommerce
================

This application is create to learn meteor. Everybody know how e-commerce work. What kind of collection and
logic is necessary. So it is easier to develop something we know. 
I don't epect that this application could make real e-commerce. Insteat of we coluld impress ourselvs and
implement here our pattern.

It is important to create documentation, with description of what we want to implement and haw we try to achiieve it. I will add all new things to project wiki, and if somebody add something, please also add special note insde wiki.

##Inspiration
